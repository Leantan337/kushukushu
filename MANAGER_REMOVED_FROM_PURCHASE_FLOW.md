# Manager Removed from Purchase Approval Flow ‚úÖ

## You Were Absolutely Right! üéØ

**Manager should NOT be in the purchase approval chain.**

Manager's role is **factory operations only** (wheat delivery, milling, gate passes, stock transfers).

---

## ‚úÖ Corrected Chain of Command

```
üëë OWNER (Top Authority)
    ‚Üì
üë§ ADMIN (Next to Owner - Has approval threshold)
    ‚Üì
üí∞ FINANCE (Tracks everything, processes payments)
    ‚Üì
üìä SALES (Requests purchases, pays from revenue or finance pays)

üè≠ MANAGER (Factory operations ONLY - NOT in purchase chain!)
```

---

## üîÑ New Purchase Request Flow

### Simple 2-Step Process:

**STEP 1: Sales Creates Request**
- System automatically routes based on amount

**STEP 2A: If Amount ‚â§ Br 50,000**
```
‚Üí ADMIN approves
‚Üí FINANCE pays
‚Üí COMPLETED
```

**STEP 2B: If Amount > Br 50,000**
```
‚Üí OWNER approves
‚Üí FINANCE pays
‚Üí COMPLETED
```

**No Manager Involvement!** ‚úã

---

## üìä Your Current Situation

### You Have:
- **7 purchase requests** with status `"pending"`
- All amounts are **under Br 50,000**
- All should go to **ADMIN** for approval

### The Issue:
- They're stuck in old status `"pending"` (waiting for manager)
- Need to change to `"pending_admin_approval"` (waiting for admin)

---

## üîß Quick Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Fix Database (Choose One Method)

**Method A: MongoDB Shell** (Fastest)
```bash
mongosh
use kushukushu_erp

db.purchase_requisitions.updateMany(
  { status: "pending" },
  [{
    $set: {
      status: {
        $cond: {
          if: { $lte: ["$estimated_cost", 50000] },
          then: "pending_admin_approval",
          else: "pending_owner_approval"
        }
      },
      routing: {
        $cond: {
          if: { $lte: ["$estimated_cost", 50000] },
          then: "admin",
          else: "owner"
        }
      },
      admin_threshold: 50000
    }
  }]
)
```

**Method B: MongoDB Compass** (GUI)
1. Open Compass ‚Üí Connect
2. Database: `kushukushu_erp`
3. Collection: `purchase_requisitions`
4. Use the aggregation from `fix_requests.mongodb.js`

**Method C: Python Script**
```python
# Run: python fix_db.py
from motor.motor_asyncio import AsyncIOMotorClient
import asyncio

async def fix():
    client = AsyncIOMotorClient('mongodb://localhost:27017')
    db = client['kushukushu_erp']
    
    result = await db.purchase_requisitions.update_many(
        {"status": "pending"},
        {"$set": {
            "status": "pending_admin_approval",
            "routing": "admin",
            "admin_threshold": 50000
        }}
    )
    print(f"‚úÖ Fixed {result.modified_count} requests")
    
asyncio.run(fix())
```

### Step 2: Verify
```bash
# Check admin queue (should show 7 requests)
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requisitions?status=pending_admin_approval"
```

### Step 3: Test Approval
```bash
# Admin approves one (replace {id})
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requisitions/{id}/approve-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"approved_by": "Admin", "notes": "Approved"}'

# Check finance queue
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requisitions?status=admin_approved"
```

## üìù What Changed in the Code

### Backend (`backend/server.py`)

#### 1. `create_purchase_request()` - NOW AUTO-ROUTES!
```python
# Before: Always created with status "pending"
status: "pending"

# After: Auto-routes based on amount
if estimated_cost <= 50000:
    status: "pending_admin_approval"
    routing: "admin"
else:
    status: "pending_owner_approval"
    routing: "owner"
```

#### 2. `approve_admin()` - NOW CHECKS THRESHOLD
```python
# Prevents admin from approving over threshold
if estimated_cost > admin_threshold:
    raise HTTPException(400, "Requires Owner approval")

# After approval:
status: "admin_approved"
next_step: "finance_payment"
```

#### 3. `approve_owner()` - FOR HIGH-VALUE ONLY
```python
# After approval:
status: "owner_approved"
next_step: "finance_payment"
```

#### 4. `approve_manager()` - ‚ùå REMOVED!
```python
# Completely removed - manager out of chain!
# Comment: "Manager approval removed - managers only 
#           handle factory operations, not purchase approvals"
```

### Frontend (`ApprovalsScreen.jsx`)

```javascript
// Before:
const response = await fetch(
  `${BACKEND_URL}/api/purchase-requisitions?status=admin_approved`
);

// After:
const response = await fetch(
  `${BACKEND_URL}/api/purchase-requisitions?status=pending_owner_approval`
);
```

## üéØ Where to See Requests

| Role | Status Filter | Location |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Admin** | `pending_admin_approval` | Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Purchase Approvals* |
| **Owner** | `pending_owner_approval` | Owner Dashboard ‚Üí Approvals ‚Üí Other Approvals |
| **Finance** | `admin_approved` OR `owner_approved` | Finance Dashboard ‚Üí Pending Authorizations |
| **Sales** | (all) | Sales Dashboard ‚Üí Purchase Request |

*To be added

## üí° Key Points

### Admin Threshold
- **Default: Br 50,000**
- Configurable in Financial Controls
- Admin can approve up to this amount
- Above this requires Owner approval

### Payment Sources
- Sales can pay from daily revenue (if available)
- Otherwise, Finance pays from company funds
- After approval from Admin or Owner

### Manager's Role
- ‚úÖ Wheat delivery approvals
- ‚úÖ Milling order approvals
- ‚úÖ Gate pass approvals  
- ‚úÖ Stock transfer approvals
- ‚ùå **NOT** purchase request approvals

---

## üß™ Test the New Flow

### Test 1: Small Purchase (Admin Path)
```bash
# Create request (Br 25,000 - under threshold)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Office Supplies",
    "estimated_cost": 25000,
    "requested_by": "Sales"
  }'

# Should create with status: "pending_admin_approval"
# Admin can approve directly!
```

### Test 2: Large Purchase (Owner Path)
```bash
# Create request (Br 75,000 - above threshold)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "New Equipment",
    "estimated_cost": 75000,
    "requested_by": "Sales"
  }'

# Should create with status: "pending_owner_approval"
# Goes directly to Owner - bypasses Admin!
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

**What You Told Me:**
> "Manager does not have a say in this. Manager's role and jurisdiction is on the factory only. Chain of command: Owner ‚Üí Admin ‚Üí Finance ‚Üí Sales. Admin has threshold that he can approve."

**What I Did:**
1. ‚úÖ Removed manager from purchase approval chain
2. ‚úÖ Made system auto-route based on amount
3. ‚úÖ Admin approves ‚â§ Br 50,000
4. ‚úÖ Owner approves > Br 50,000
5. ‚úÖ Finance processes all approved payments
6. ‚úÖ Rebuilt frontend successfully

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Run MongoDB fix command (see Step 1 above)
2. Your 7 pending requests will appear in Admin queue
3. Admin can approve them immediately!

---

**The purchase request flow is now correct!** ‚úÖ

Manager is out, threshold routing is in, and your organizational structure is properly reflected in the code.
