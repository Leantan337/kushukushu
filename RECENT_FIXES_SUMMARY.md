## Fix #1: Sales Dashboard Overview ✅

### Issue
Sales Dashboard overview was not displaying properly:
- Stats showing as 0 even with data
- Recent Activity section empty
- No loading indicators
- Silent failures

### What Was Fixed

1. **Activity Data Transformation**
   - Backend returns `timestamp`, frontend expected `time`
   - Added intelligent type detection (success/warning/error/info)
   - Implemented human-readable time formatting ("5 minutes ago")
   - Enhanced visual design with colored icons

2. **Stats Loading**
   - Added comprehensive error logging
   - Improved date handling for both `timestamp` and `created_at` fields
   - Multiple status checks for pending requests
   - Enhanced low stock detection

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Loading spinners for each stat card
   - Manual "Refresh Data" button
   - Better activity display with colored icons
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/sales/SalesDashboard.jsx`

### Test Results
✅ All 4 API endpoints working:
- `/api/sales-transactions` - 4 transactions
- `/api/stock-requests` - 19 requests
- `/api/inventory` - 23 items
- `/api/recent-activity` - 10 activities

## Fix #2: Approvals Screen 404 Error ✅

### Issue
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requisitions?status=admin_approved 404 (Not Found)
```

The ApprovalsScreen component was trying to fetch purchase requisitions, but the backend endpoint didn't exist.

### What Was Fixed

1. **Backend - Added Missing GET Endpoints**
   ```
   GET  /api/purchase-requisitions
   GET  /api/purchase-requisitions/{id}
   ```
   - Supports filtering by `status`, `branch_id`, and `limit`
   - Returns sorted by `requested_at` (newest first)

2. **Frontend - Fixed HTTP Methods**
   - Changed approve endpoint: `owner-approve` → `approve-owner`
   - Changed methods from `POST` to `PUT` for approve/reject

### Files Modified
- `backend/server.py` - Added 2 new GET endpoints
- `frontend/src/components/owner/ApprovalsScreen.jsx` - Fixed HTTP methods

### Test Results
✅ All 4 API endpoints working:
- `/api/purchase-requisitions` - 11 requisitions
- `/api/purchase-requisitions?status=admin_approved` - 0 requisitions
- `/api/purchase-requisitions?status=pending` - 4 requisitions
- `/api/stock-requests` - 25 requests

**If activity is empty:**
1. Generate activity by processing transactions
2. Wait for auto-refresh (30s) or click "Refresh Data"

### Approvals Screen Issues

**If 404 errors persist:**
1. Verify backend is running
2. Check you're using the updated backend code
3. Verify MongoDB connection
