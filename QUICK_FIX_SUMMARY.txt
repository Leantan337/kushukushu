                    APPROVAL WORKFLOWS - ALL FIXED! âœ…
================================================================================

ISSUE: Purchase request form was not working properly
STATUS: FIXED AND VERIFIED

================================================================================
                              WHAT WAS DONE
================================================================================

1. IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM
   - Purchase request endpoint was ignoring most form fields
   - Only saving: description, cost, reason, requested_by
   - Ignoring: branch_id, purchase_type, category, vendor info

2. FIXED THE BACKEND
   - File: backend/server.py (line 2850)
   - Changed to accept ALL fields using **requisition.model_dump()
   - Now properly stores ALL form data

3. CREATED COMPREHENSIVE TESTS
   - test_approval_workflows.py - Automated test suite
   - Tests purchase requests âœ…
   - Tests stock requests âœ…
   - Tests rejection workflow âœ…

4. ALL TESTS PASSED (3/3) ðŸŽ‰
   âœ… Purchase Request: Sales â†’ Manager â†’ Admin â†’ Owner
   âœ… Stock Request: Sales â†’ Admin â†’ Manager â†’ Storekeeper
   âœ… Rejection: Any stage can reject with reason
