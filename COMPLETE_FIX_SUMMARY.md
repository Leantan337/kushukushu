---

## Issues Fixed (In Order)

### Issue #1: Sales Dashboard Overview Not Working ✅
**Problem:** Stats showing 0, activity feed empty  
**Fixed:** Data transformation, loading states, better error handling  
**Result:** Sales Dashboard fully functional

### Issue #2: Owner Approvals Screen 404 Error ✅  
**Problem:** Missing GET endpoint for purchase requisitions  
**Fixed:** Added `/api/purchase-requisitions` endpoint  
**Result:** Owner can fetch purchase requisitions

### Issue #3: Incorrect Purchase Request Flow ✅
**Problem:** Manager was in approval chain (shouldn't be!)  
**Fixed:** 
- Removed manager approval
- Added automatic routing based on amount
- Admin approves ≤ Br 50,000
- Owner approves > Br 50,000
**Result:** Correct organizational structure implemented

### Issue #4: Purchase Requests Stuck in Old Status ✅
**Problem:** 7 requests with status "pending" (old workflow)  
**Fixed:** Updated all to "pending_admin_approval" in database  
**Result:** All requests using correct flow

### Issue #5: Admin Can't See Purchase Requests ✅
**Problem:** No Admin Purchase Approvals screen  
**Fixed:** Created `AdminPurchaseApprovals.jsx` component and route  
**Result:** Admin has dedicated screen at `/admin/purchase-approvals`

### Issue #6: Finance Not Showing Admin-Approved Requests ✅
**Problem:** Finance only looked for "owner_approved" status  
**Fixed:** 
- Backend now fetches BOTH "admin_approved" and "owner_approved"
- Finance Dashboard shows correct status text
- Process Payment button now visible for both types
**Result:** Finance sees all 8 requests ready for payment

## The Correct Flow (Now Fully Implemented)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    PURCHASE REQUEST FLOW                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. SALES creates purchase request
   ↓
2. System automatically routes based on amount
   ↓
   ├──→ Amount ≤ Br 50,000
   │    ↓
   │    ADMIN sees in /admin/purchase-approvals ✅
   │    ↓
   │    ADMIN approves
   │    ↓
   │    Status: "admin_approved"
   │
   └──→ Amount > Br 50,000
        ↓
        OWNER sees in /approvals (Other Approvals tab) ✅
        ↓
        OWNER approves
        ↓
        Status: "owner_approved"
   
   ↓ (Both paths merge here)
   
3. FINANCE sees in dashboard (Pending Approvals tab) ✅
   Status badge: "Admin Approved" or "Owner Approved - Ready to Pay"
   Button: "Process Payment" visible
   ↓
4. FINANCE processes payment
   ↓
5. Status: "completed"
```

**Manager is NOT in this flow!** Manager handles factory operations only.
