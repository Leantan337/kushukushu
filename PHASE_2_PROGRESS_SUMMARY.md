# Phase 2 Implementation Progress - Stock Request Workflow

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Phase:** 2 - Stock Request Workflow (Multi-Level Approval)  
**Status:** 🚧 **60% Complete** (Backend done, Frontend in progress)

---

## 🎯 Phase 2 Goals

Implement complete 6-stage approval workflow for stock requests:
1. **Sales** creates request
2. **Admin/Owner** approves → reserves inventory
3. **Manager** approves → authorizes fulfillment
4. **Storekeeper** fulfills → deducts inventory
5. **Guard** verifies at gate → issues gate pass
6. **Sales** confirms delivery → inventory transferred

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 2.1 Workflow Models & Database Schema ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- ✅ Updated `InternalOrderStatus` enum with 11 new statuses
- ✅ Enhanced `InternalOrderRequisition` model with workflow tracking
- ✅ Created `WorkflowStage` model for tracking each stage
- ✅ Added inventory reservation fields
- ✅ Added workflow history tracking
- ✅ Created action models for each stage:
  - `AdminApprovalAction`
  - `ManagerApprovalAction`
  - `FulfillmentAction`
  - `GateVerificationAction`
  - `DeliveryConfirmationAction`
  - `InternalOrderRejection`

**New Statuses:**
```python
PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL     # Stage 1: Waiting for admin
ADMIN_APPROVED              # Admin approved
PENDING_MANAGER_APPROVAL    # Stage 2: Waiting for manager
MANAGER_APPROVED            # Manager approved
PENDING_FULFILLMENT         # Stage 3: Waiting for storekeeper
READY_FOR_PICKUP            # Packaged and ready
AT_GATE                     # Stage 4: At gate checkpoint
IN_TRANSIT                  # Stage 5: Out for delivery
DELIVERED                   # Arrived at destination
CONFIRMED                   # Stage 6: Sales confirmed receipt
REJECTED                    # Rejected at any stage
```

### 2.7 Branch-Specific Routing ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- ✅ Created `determine_source_branch()` helper function
- ✅ Automatic product-to-warehouse mapping
- ✅ Validates product availability before request creation

**Product Routing:**
```javascript
Product Mapping:
- 1st Quality products → main_warehouse
- Bread Flour products → girmay_warehouse
- White Fruskela → main_warehouse
- Red Fruskela → girmay_warehouse
- Furska → main_warehouse
```

**How it Works:**
```python
# Auto-detects source branch when request is created
source_branch = await determine_source_branch(product_name)

# Example:
"1st Quality 50kg" → main_warehouse
"Bread Flour 25kg" → girmay_warehouse
```

---

### 2.8 Inventory Reservation System ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- ✅ Created `reserve_inventory()` function
- ✅ Created `deduct_inventory_for_fulfillment()` function
- ✅ Created `add_inventory_for_delivery()` function
- ✅ Inventory state tracking (available → reserved → deducted → transferred)

**Inventory Flow:**
```
1. Request Created
   → Check availability
   → Validate stock exists
   
2. Admin Approves
   → inventory_reserved = true
   → Stock marked as "reserved" (not yet deducted)
   
3. Storekeeper Fulfills
   → inventory_deducted = true
   → Stock physically removed from warehouse
   → Inventory quantity decremented
   
4. Sales Confirms
   → delivery_confirmed = true
   → Stock added to destination branch
   → Complete transfer
```

**Functions:**
- `reserve_inventory()` - Validates availability
- `deduct_inventory_for_fulfillment()` - Removes from source
- `add_inventory_for_delivery()` - Adds to destination

---

### Backend API Endpoints ✓
