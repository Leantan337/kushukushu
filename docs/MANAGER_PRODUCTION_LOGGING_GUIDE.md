# Manager Production Logging System - Complete Guide

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Purpose:** Track production outputs and by-products for each branch

---

## 🎯 Overview

The Manager Production Logging System allows managers to:
1. **Record wheat deliveries** from suppliers
2. **Create milling orders** that consume raw wheat
3. **Log production outputs** - finished products and by-products from milling

This ensures complete traceability from raw materials to finished products.

---

## 🏭 The Production Workflow

### Step 1: Record Wheat Delivery
**When:** Raw wheat arrives from suppliers

**Action:** Manager logs the delivery
- Supplier name
- Quantity (kg)
- Quality rating (Excellent/Good/Average/Poor)

**Result:** Raw wheat is automatically added to branch inventory

**Example:**
```
Supplier: Tigray Cooperative
Quantity: 3000kg
Quality: Excellent
→ Branch inventory "Raw Wheat" increases by 3000kg
```

---

### Step 2: Create Milling Order
**When:** Manager wants to process raw wheat into finished products

**Action:** Manager creates milling order
- Specify how much raw wheat to use (e.g., 1000kg)

**Result:** 
- Milling order is created with status "Pending"
- Raw wheat is deducted from inventory immediately
- Order appears in "Complete Order" tab waiting for output logging

**Example:**
```
Raw Wheat Input: 1000kg
→ Branch inventory "Raw Wheat" decreases by 1000kg
→ Milling Order #ABC12345 created (Status: Pending)
```

---

### Step 3: Log Production Outputs ⭐ **NEW FEATURE**
**When:** Milling is complete and products are ready

**Action:** Manager logs ALL outputs from the milling order
- Go to "Complete Order" tab
- Select the pending milling order
- Add each finished product and by-product
- Enter exact quantities produced

**Result:**
- All logged products are added to branch inventory
- Milling order status changes to "Completed"
- Complete production record is maintained

**Example - Berhane Branch:**
```
Milling Order #ABC12345 (Input: 1000kg Raw Wheat)

Outputs logged:
✓ Bread Flour: 650kg       (Main product)
✓ Fruska: 200kg            (By-product: Bran)
✓ Fruskelo Red: 120kg      (By-product: Fine bran)

→ Total output: 970kg (97% recovery rate)
→ All products added to Berhane inventory
→ Order marked as completed
```

**Example - Girmay Branch:**
```
Milling Order #XYZ67890 (Input: 1500kg Raw Wheat)

Outputs logged:
✓ 1st Quality Flour: 800kg    (Main product - ONLY Girmay produces this)
✓ Bread Flour: 300kg          (Secondary product)
✓ Fruska: 250kg               (By-product: Bran)
✓ Fruskelo White: 100kg       (By-product: Fine white bran)

→ Total output: 1450kg (96.7% recovery rate)
→ All products added to Girmay inventory
→ Order marked as completed
```

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. **Accurate Recording**
- Log outputs immediately after milling
- Record ALL products, including by-products
- Use precise weights from your scale

### 2. **Complete Documentation**
```
✅ DO: Log main product + all by-products
   Example: 1000kg wheat → 650kg flour + 200kg fruska + 120kg fruskelo

❌ DON'T: Only log main product
   Example: 1000kg wheat → 650kg flour (missing by-products!)
```

### 3. **Recovery Rate Tracking**
Typical recovery rates:
- **Total output:** 95-98% of input weight
- **Main flour:** 60-70% of input
- **Bran products:** 25-30% of input
- **Loss (dust, moisture):** 2-5%

If your recovery rate is too low, investigate:
- Equipment issues
- Measurement errors
- Missing by-products

### 4. **Quality Control**
Different wheat qualities produce different outputs:
- **Excellent wheat** → Higher flour yield
- **Poor wheat** → More bran, less flour

## 🎓 Training Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Milling
**Situation:** Process 500kg raw wheat at Berhane

**Steps:**
1. Create milling order for 500kg
2. After milling, log outputs:
   - Bread Flour: 325kg
   - Fruska: 100kg
   - Fruskelo Red: 60kg
3. Total: 485kg (97% recovery)

### Scenario 2: Premium Production (Girmay Only)
**Situation:** Process 1000kg raw wheat for 1st Quality flour

**Steps:**
1. Create milling order for 1000kg
2. After milling, log outputs:
   - 1st Quality Flour: 600kg (main product)
   - Bread Flour: 100kg (secondary)
   - Fruska: 180kg
   - Fruskelo White: 90kg
3. Total: 970kg (97% recovery)

### Scenario 3: Multiple Orders
**Situation:** Two milling orders in same day

**Steps:**
1. Morning: Create order #1 (1000kg)
2. Process and log outputs for order #1
3. Afternoon: Create order #2 (1500kg)
4. Process and log outputs for order #2
5. Each order tracked separately with its own outputs

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient raw wheat"
**Problem:** Can't create milling order  
**Solution:** Record wheat delivery first

### "No pending orders"
**Problem:** Nothing in Complete Order tab  
**Solution:** Create a milling order first

### "Product not in dropdown"
**Problem:** Can't find product to log  
**Solution:** That product is not produced by your branch. Check branch-specific products list above.

### "Total output seems low"
**Problem:** 1000kg input → 600kg output  
**Solution:** Make sure you logged ALL by-products, not just main flour

---

## 🔐 Security & Validation

### Automatic Checks
- ✅ Can't use more raw wheat than available
- ✅ Can only log outputs for YOUR branch
- ✅ Can only select products from YOUR branch
- ✅ Can't complete same order twice
- ✅ All quantities must be positive

### Branch Isolation
- ✅ Berhane managers see only Berhane inventory
- ✅ Girmay managers see only Girmay inventory
- ✅ Cannot mix products between branches
