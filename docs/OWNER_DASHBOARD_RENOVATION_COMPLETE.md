   - Displays loading spinner
   - Renders all sections when data arrives
   ```

2. **Auto-Refresh Cycle**:
   ```javascript
   - Every 30 seconds:
     * Fetches all 3 endpoints again
     * Updates state with new data
     * Shows refresh spinner in button
     * No page reload needed
   ```

3. **Manual Refresh**:
   ```javascript
   - User clicks "Refresh" button
   - Immediate fetch of all endpoints
   - Toast notification confirms refresh
   - Data updates in real-time
   ```

4. **Activity Expansion**:
