## 📈 Inventory Valuation Formula

```
For each item:
-------------------
Inventory Value = quantity × current_unit_cost
Selling Value = quantity × unit_selling_price
Potential Profit = Selling Value - Inventory Value
Profit Margin % = (Potential Profit ÷ Inventory Value) × 100

Total Business Inventory:
-------------------------
Sum all items' inventory values
Sum all items' selling values
Calculate total potential profit
Calculate overall margin
```

**Example**:
```
Product: Premium Wheat Flour
Quantity: 500 kg
Current Cost: 65 ETB/kg
Selling Price: 85.50 ETB/kg

Inventory Value: 500 × 65 = 32,500 ETB
Selling Value: 500 × 85.50 = 42,750 ETB
Potential Profit: 42,750 - 32,500 = 10,250 ETB
Margin: (10,250 ÷ 32,500) × 100 = 31.5%
```

## 🔐 Accountability Chain

### For Every Financial Transaction:
```
WHO: processed_by field (Finance officer name)
WHAT: Transaction type, category, amount
WHEN: Transaction timestamp
WHY: Description and reason
HOW: Payment method, bank account
WHERE: Branch allocation
STATUS: Reconciliation status
APPROVED BY: who authorized (for large amounts)
```

### For Large Payments (> 1M):
```
1. Finance Officer requests funds
   └─ Logged: Who requested, when, why, amount
   
2. Owner reviews request
   └─ Logged: Who reviewed, when, decision

3. If approved, Finance processes
   └─ Logged: Who processed, when, payment details

4. Complete chain visible in audit trail
```
