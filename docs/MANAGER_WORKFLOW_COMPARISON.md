## 🔴 BEFORE: Centralized Manager Without Branch Isolation

### Login Flow
```
1. Enter username/password
2. Select "Manager" role
3. ❌ No branch selection
4. Login to manager dashboard
```

### Manager Dashboard
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Manager Dashboard                       │
│  Welcome back, Yohannes Teklu           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  ⚠️ Shows ALL inventory from all branches
│  ⚠️ Can see all pending approvals       │
│  ⚠️ Manages both Berhane AND Girmay     │
│                                         │
│  Raw Wheat Stock: 24,300kg              │
│  (Combined from both branches)          │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Milling Order Workflow (BEFORE)
```
Step 1: Manager creates milling order request
        ↓
Step 2: ⏳ WAIT for Owner approval
        ↓
Step 3: Owner reviews and approves
        ↓
Step 4: ✅ Milling order can now start
        ↓
Step 5: Manager completes milling
```
**Problem**: Required owner approval, slowing down operations

### Inventory Management (BEFORE)
```
Manager sees:
├─ Raw Wheat: 24,300kg ❌ (combined both branches)
├─ 1st Quality Flour: 8,100kg ❌ (combined)
├─ Bread Flour: 5,400kg ❌ (combined)
└─ Fruska: 2,500kg ❌ (combined)

⚠️ Cannot distinguish between branches
⚠️ May use wrong branch's inventory
⚠️ No isolation between operations
```

## 🟢 AFTER: Branch-Isolated Manager

### Login Flow
```
1. Enter username/password
2. Select "Manager" role
3. ✅ SELECT BRANCH (Berhane or Girmay)
4. Login to branch-specific dashboard

```

### Milling Order Workflow (AFTER)
```
Step 1: Manager creates milling order
        ↓
Step 2: ✅ IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (no approval needed)
        ↓
Step 3: Raw wheat deducted from branch inventory
        ↓
Step 4: Manager completes milling
        ↓
Step 5: Finished products added to branch inventory
```
**Benefit**: No approval required, immediate execution

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Wheat Delivery

#### BEFORE:
```
1. Truck arrives with 5,000kg wheat
2. Manager records delivery
3. ❌ Wheat added to "general" inventory
4. ⚠️ Unclear which branch owns it
5. ⚠️ Other branch might use it by mistake
```

#### AFTER:
```
1. Truck arrives at Berhane branch
2. Berhane manager records delivery
3. ✅ Wheat added to Berhane inventory
4. ✅ Clearly tracked as Berhane's wheat
5. ✅ Girmay cannot access it
```

---

### Scenario 2: Creating Milling Order

#### BEFORE:
```
1. Manager: "I need to mill 3,000kg wheat"
2. Manager creates order request
3. ⏳ Order status: Pending Owner Approval
4. Wait for owner to login and approve
5. Owner approves (could take hours/days)
6. ✅ Now manager can start milling
7. Manager completes the milling
```
**Time**: Hours to days (waiting for approval)

#### AFTER:
```
1. Berhane manager: "I need to mill 3,000kg wheat"
2. Manager creates milling order
3. ✅ Order status: Pending (ready to mill)
4. 3,000kg raw wheat immediately deducted from Berhane inventory
5. Manager completes the milling
6. Finished products added to Berhane inventory
```
**Time**: Minutes (no approval wait)

---

### Scenario 3: Stock Request Approval

#### BEFORE:
```
Manager Approval Queue:
├─ Request from Berhane sales (500kg) ✅
├─ Request from Girmay sales (300kg) ❌ (wrong branch)
├─ Request from Berhane sales (200kg) ✅
└─ Request from Girmay sales (400kg) ❌ (wrong branch)

⚠️ Manager might approve wrong branch requests
⚠️ Confusion about which requests to handle
⚠️ Both branches mixed together
```

#### AFTER:
```
Berhane Manager Approval Queue:
├─ Request from Berhane sales (500kg) ✅
├─ Request from Berhane sales (200kg) ✅
└─ Only Berhane branch requests shown

Girmay Manager Approval Queue:
├─ Request from Girmay sales (300kg) ✅
├─ Request from Girmay sales (400kg) ✅
└─ Only Girmay branch requests shown

✅ Clear separation
✅ No confusion
✅ Each manager handles only their branch
```

## System Architecture Changes

### BEFORE: Centralized Manager
