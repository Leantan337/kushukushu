# Owner Dashboard Fixes Applied

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Error ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: 
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/owner/activity-feed?limit=50' 
from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Root Cause**: CORS middleware was not configured in the FastAPI backend

**Solution**: Added CORS middleware configuration to `backend/server.py`:
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

**Location**: Lines 26-33 in `backend/server.py`

---

### 2. Activity Feed Sorting Error ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: 
```python
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'str'
  File "backend\server.py", line 4202, in get_owner_activity_feed
    activities.sort(key=lambda x: x.get("timestamp", ""), reverse=True)
```

**Root Cause**: Some activities had `None` or missing timestamps, causing the sort to fail when comparing None with strings

**Solution**: Filter out activities without timestamps before sorting:
```python
# Filter out activities without timestamps and handle None values
activities_with_time = [a for a in activities if a.get("timestamp")]
activities_with_time.sort(key=lambda x: x.get("timestamp", "1970-01-01T00:00:00"), reverse=True)

# Return limited results
return activities_with_time[:limit]
```

**Location**: Lines 4201-4207 in `backend/server.py`

---

## Files Modified

1. **backend/server.py**
   - Added CORS middleware (lines 26-33)
   - Fixed activity feed sorting logic (lines 4201-4207)

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn server:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 3. Access Owner Dashboard
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login and select "Owner" role
3. Navigate to `/dashboard`
4. Dashboard should now load without errors

### 4. Verify Fixes
- ✅ No CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ Activity feed loads successfully
- ✅ All 3 API endpoints respond correctly:
  - `/api/owner/dashboard-summary` - Returns financial KPIs
  - `/api/owner/branch-stats` - Returns branch comparison data
  - `/api/owner/activity-feed?limit=50` - Returns activity feed

---

## Expected Behavior

### Dashboard Loads Successfully
- 6 Financial KPI cards display at top
- Branch comparison shows Berhane and Girmay side-by-side
- Activity feed populates with recent activities
- Auto-refresh works every 30 seconds
- Manual refresh button works
- All tabs (Overview, Sales, Manager, Finance, Storekeeper, Admin) work correctly

### No Errors
- No CORS errors
- No TypeError in activity feed
- All API calls return 200 OK

---

## Additional Notes

### CORS Configuration
The CORS middleware now allows:
- Origins: `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Credentials: Enabled
- Methods: All (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Headers: All

If you need to deploy to production, update the `allow_origins` to include your production domain.

### Activity Feed Logic
The activity feed now:
1. Collects activities from 7 different sources
2. Filters out any activities without valid timestamps
3. Sorts by timestamp in descending order (most recent first)
4. Returns only the requested limit (default 50)

---

## Status: ✅ READY FOR USE

Both issues are now fixed. The Owner Dashboard should work perfectly with:
- Real-time activity monitoring across all roles
- Financial KPIs display
- Branch comparison
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Manual refresh
- Role-specific tabs

**Restart your backend server and the dashboard will work!**
