8. Inventory transferred: Girmay → Berhane
```

   - Berhane: 2000kg
   - Girmay: 1800kg

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No products showing in POS
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Run product setup
cd backend
python update_branch_products.py

# Restart backend
python server.py
```

### Issue: TDF Service appears in POS
**Problem:** Should NOT appear  
**Check:** `is_sellable: false` flag set correctly  
**Fix:** Re-run `update_branch_products.py`

### Issue: Stock request doesn't route correctly
**Check:** Product name matches exactly  
**Verify:** `determine_source_branch()` function in `server.py`  
**Test:** Make request and check `source_branch` field

### Issue: Can sell products from wrong branch
**Problem:** Branch filter not working  
**Check:** POS has branch selector  
**Verify:** `currentBranch` state is being used

## 🎓 Key Points to Remember

1. **Each branch is independent** - Own inventory, own products
2. **1st Quality is Girmay-exclusive** - Only they produce it
3. **Bread & Bran are shared** - Both branches produce
4. **Fruskelo White is Girmay-exclusive** - Only they produce it
5. **TDF Service is Berhane special** - Not for sale, tracking only
6. **Stock requests auto-route** - System determines source
7. **POS shows branch products only** - Can't sell what you don't have
