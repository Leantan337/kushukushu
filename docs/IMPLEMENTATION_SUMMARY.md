## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Payment Flow
```
Sale → Payment Type Selected
  ├─ Cash → Cash Account (Finance)
  ├─ Check → Bank Account (Finance)
  ├─ Transfer → Bank Account (Finance)
  └─ Loan → Loan Account (Finance) + Customer + Loan Record
```

### Stock Request Flow
```
Sales Request
  ↓ (Auto routes to correct warehouse)
Admin Approves
  ↓ (Reserves inventory)
Manager Approves
  ↓ (Authorizes fulfillment)
Storekeeper Fulfills
  ↓ (Deducts from source)
Guard Verifies
  ↓ (Issues gate pass)
Sales Confirms
  ↓ (Adds to destination)
COMPLETE!
```

### Loan Flow
```
Loan Sale → Customer Created/Found → Loan Created → Due Date Set (30 days)
              ↓
Payment Received → Balance Updated → Customer Credit Updated → Finance Income
              ↓
If Balance = 0 → Loan Status = PAID
```
