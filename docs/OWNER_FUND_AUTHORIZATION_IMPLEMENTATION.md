## 💰 Real-Time Inventory Valuation System

### How It Works

**When Purchase is Made**:
```
1. PR created: estimated_cost = 8,000,000 (500 tons wheat)
2. Supplier quotes: quoted_cost = 8,200,000 (+2.5%)
3. Owner approves despite variance
4. Finance pays: final_cost = 8,200,000
5. System calculates:
   - cost_variance = 200,000
   - cost_variance_percent = 2.5%
6. Wheat received into inventory
7. Inventory updated:
   - actual_unit_cost = 16,400 ETB/ton
   - current_unit_cost = 16,400 ETB/ton
   - quantity = 500 tons
   - total_inventory_value = 8,200,000 ETB
   - last_purchase_cost = 16,400
   - last_purchase_date = today
8. Cost added to history
```

**Real-Time Valuation**:
- Every inventory item has monetary value
- Automatic recalculation when:
  - Purchase received (updates cost)
  - Sale made (reduces quantity, recalculates value)
  - Production (raw materials → finished goods)
  - Price changes (manual update)

**Visibility**:
- Owner Dashboard: See total inventory worth instantly
- Reports: Inventory valuation by branch/category
- Profit Analysis: Selling value - cost value = potential profit

## 🔒 Financial Control & Accountability

### Authorization Levels

**Level 1: Auto-Process (< 100K)**
- Finance processes immediately
- No additional approval needed
- Fast for routine small expenses

**Level 2: Normal Process (100K - 1M)**
- Standard PR approval chain only
- Finance processes after Owner approves PR
- No separate fund request

**Level 3: Fund Authorization (> 1M)**
- PR approval chain completes
- Finance must request fund authorization
- Owner reviews and approves fund release separately
- Finance then processes payment
- **Dual control**: PR approval + fund approval

**Level 4: Multi-Signature (> 5M)**
- All of Level 3, plus:
- Both Owner and Admin must sign
- Additional security for very large amounts

### Spending Limits Enforcement

**Daily Limit (5M ETB)**:
- Finance tracks spending throughout the day
- Payment blocked if would exceed limit
- Clear error message with remaining balance
- Owner can adjust limit via settings

**Monthly Limit (50M ETB)**:
- Cumulative tracking from 1st of month
- Prevents excessive monthly spending
- Warning at 80% threshold
- Owner oversight of monthly patterns

### Finance Officer Accountability

Every payment tracks:
- ✅ **Who**: Finance officer name (processed_by)
- ✅ **When**: Transaction timestamp
- ✅ **How much**: Spent today/this month
- ✅ **Remaining**: Limits available
- ✅ **Threshold**: Which level (auto/normal/owner/multi-sig)

Owner can view:
- Finance officer spending reports
- Daily/monthly spending patterns
- Payments processed vs limits
- Fund requests submitted vs approved
