## üîÑ Inventory Management

### Database Schema
Each product in the inventory includes:
- `branch_id`: "berhane" or "girmay"
- `branch_name`: "Berhane Branch" or "Girmay Branch"
- `is_tdf`: Boolean flag for TDF products (Berhane only)
- `tdf_source`: "Tigray Defense Force" for TDF products
- `notes`: Special production notes

### Branch Isolation
- **POS System**: Shows only products from the user's assigned branch
- **Stock Requests**: Automatically route to the correct producing branch
- **Inventory**: Each branch maintains separate inventory records

### Product Routing Logic
The system uses `determine_source_branch()` function to route requests:

```python
# ONLY Girmay produces:
"1st Quality" ‚Üí "girmay"
"Fruskelo White" ‚Üí "girmay"

# ONLY Berhane produces:
"TDF" ‚Üí "berhane"
"Fruskelo Red" ‚Üí "berhane"

# Both branches produce:
"Bread" ‚Üí "both" (routes to branch with higher stock)
"Fruska" ‚Üí "both" (routes to branch with higher stock)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Update Product Database
Run the branch product seeder script:
```bash
cd backend
python update_branch_products.py
```

This will:
- Add all Berhane-specific products (including TDF products)
- Add all Girmay-specific products (including 1st Quality and White Fruskelo)
- Skip duplicates if already exists
- Display summary of products per branch

### 2. Verify Configuration
Check the database to ensure:
- Berhane has: Bread (2), Fruska (1), Fruskelo Red (1), TDF Bread (2) = **6 products**
- Girmay has: 1st Quality (4), Bread (2), Fruska (1), Fruskelo White (1) = **8 products**

### 3. Test Branch Isolation
- Login to POS at Berhane ‚Üí Should see only Berhane products
- Login to POS at Girmay ‚Üí Should see only Girmay products (including 1st Quality)
- Stock requests for 1st Quality ‚Üí Should route to Girmay
- Stock requests for TDF products ‚Üí Should route to Berhane

## üìù Implementation Files

### Backend Files
- `backend/update_branch_products.py` - Product seeder with branch-specific products
- `backend/server.py` - Contains `determine_source_branch()` routing logic
- `backend/seed_branch_inventory.py` - Raw materials inventory seeder

### Frontend Components
- `frontend/src/components/sales/POSTransaction.jsx` - Branch-filtered POS
- `frontend/src/components/sales/InventoryRequestForm.jsx` - Stock request routing
- All sales components use `branch_id` filtering

---

## ‚úÖ Key Business Rules

1. **1st Quality Flour**: Exclusive to Girmay Branch
2. **TDF Products**: Exclusive to Berhane Branch (TDF wheat source)
3. **Fruskelo Red**: Exclusive to Berhane Branch
4. **Fruskelo White**: Exclusive to Girmay Branch
5. **Bread & Fruska**: Available at both branches
6. **Branch Isolation**: Users only see/sell products from their assigned branch

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Wrong products showing in POS
**Solution**: Verify user's `branch_id` matches product's `branch_id`

### Issue: Stock request routed to wrong branch
**Solution**: Check `determine_source_branch()` logic in server.py

### Issue: TDF products showing at Girmay
**Solution**: Re-run `update_branch_products.py` and verify TDF products only have `branch_id: "berhane"`

### Issue: 1st Quality showing at Berhane
**Solution**: Re-run `update_branch_products.py` and verify 1st Quality products only have `branch_id: "girmay"`
