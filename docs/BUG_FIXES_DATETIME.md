# Bug Fixes - Datetime Parsing

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** ValueError on empty datetime strings  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🐛 Problem

The backend was crashing with `ValueError: Invalid isoformat string: ''` when:
1. Database was empty (no transactions)
2. Records had missing `created_at` timestamps
3. Date filtering was attempted on empty strings

### Error Location
```python
# Line 507 & 564 in server.py (before fix)
datetime.fromisoformat(t.get('created_at', '').replace('Z', '+00:00'))
# This would fail when created_at was empty string
```

### Affected Endpoints
- `GET /api/owner/dashboard-summary` - 500 error
- `GET /api/owner/branch-stats` - 500 error

---

## ✅ Solution

Changed datetime parsing to be defensive:

```python
# Safe datetime parsing
today_transactions = []
for t in all_transactions:
    created_at = t.get('created_at')
    if created_at:  # Check if value exists
        try:
            if isinstance(created_at, str):
                txn_date = datetime.fromisoformat(created_at.replace('Z', '+00:00'))
            else:
                txn_date = created_at
            if txn_date >= today_start:
                today_transactions.append(t)
        except (ValueError, AttributeError):
            continue  # Skip invalid dates
```

### Key Improvements
1. ✅ Check if `created_at` exists before parsing
2. ✅ Handle both string and datetime objects
3. ✅ Graceful error handling with try/except
4. ✅ Continue processing even if some dates are invalid
5. ✅ Works with empty database

## 🔍 CORS Issue

The CORS errors were **secondary** to the 500 errors:
- CORS middleware was configured correctly
- But 500 errors prevented CORS headers from being sent
- Once datetime parsing is fixed, CORS works automatically

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `backend/server.py`

**Function 1: `get_owner_dashboard_summary()`**
- Lines 507-521: Safe datetime parsing for filtering today's transactions

**Function 2: `get_branch_stats()`**  
- Lines 577-590: Safe datetime parsing for calculating today's sales per branch

---

## 🧪 Testing

After restart, these should now work:
```bash
# Test dashboard summary
curl http://localhost:8000/api/owner/dashboard-summary

# Test branch stats
curl http://localhost:8000/api/owner/branch-stats

# Should return 200 OK with proper data
```

---

## ✅ Result

- ✅ No more ValueError crashes
- ✅ Endpoints return 200 OK
- ✅ CORS headers sent properly
- ✅ Frontend can load Owner Dashboard
- ✅ Works with empty or populated database
