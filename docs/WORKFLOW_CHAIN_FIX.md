# Sales → Owner → Manager Workflow Chain - FIXED

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Issue:** Sales requests not appearing in Manager queue  
**Root Cause:** Owner/Admin using mock data instead of real backend  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 Problem Identified

### User Report:
> "Sales requested but it didn't show in manager. The workflow chain of command:  
> Sales (request) → Admin/Owner → Manager  
> I think the request is getting lost because admin/owner are using mock data"

### Root Cause Analysis:

**Correct Workflow Chain:**
```
1. Sales creates request → Status: PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL
2. Owner/Admin approves → Status: ADMIN_APPROVED → PENDING_MANAGER_APPROVAL
3. Manager approves → Status: MANAGER_APPROVED
4. Storekeeper fulfills → Status: DELIVERED
```

**The Problem:**
- ✅ Backend workflow is correct (lines 1860-1919 in server.py)
- ✅ Sales creates requests correctly
- ❌ **Owner/Admin dashboard was using MOCK DATA**
- ❌ **ApprovalsScreen.jsx was not connected to real backend**

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### File Changed: `frontend/src/components/owner/ApprovalsScreen.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
import { mockData } from "../../data/mockData";

const ApprovalsScreen = () => {
  const [approvals, setApprovals] = useState(mockData.approvals);
  
  // All approval data was from mockData
  // No backend integration
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
import StockRequestApprovals from "./StockRequestApprovals";
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "../ui/tabs";

const ApprovalsScreen = () => {
  // Added tabs to separate real data from mock data
  
  return (
    <Tabs defaultValue="stock-requests">
      <TabsList>
        <TabsTrigger value="stock-requests">
          Stock Requests (Real Data)
        </TabsTrigger>
        <TabsTrigger value="other">
          Other Approvals
        </TabsTrigger>
      </TabsList>
      
      {/* REAL BACKEND DATA */}
      <TabsContent value="stock-requests">
        <StockRequestApprovals />
      </TabsContent>
      
      {/* Mock data kept for other approval types */}
      <TabsContent value="other">
        {/* ... existing mock approval code ... */}
      </TabsContent>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

## 🎯 What Changed

### 1. Owner Approvals Screen - Now Has Tabs

**Tab 1: Stock Requests (Real Data)**
- Uses `StockRequestApprovals` component
- Fetches from: `GET /api/stock-requests?status=pending_admin_approval`
- Approves via: `PUT /api/stock-requests/{id}/approve-admin`
- ✅ **Connected to real backend**

**Tab 2: Other Approvals (Mock Data)**
- Purchase requests
- Payment approvals
- Contract approvals
- (These will be connected to backend later)

### 2. Backend Workflow (Already Correct)

**Endpoint: PUT /api/stock-requests/{request_id}/approve-admin**

```python
# Line 1878-1879: Set status to ADMIN_APPROVED
update_data = {
    "status": InternalOrderStatus.ADMIN_APPROVED,
    "admin_approval": serialize_datetime(approval_record.model_dump()),
    "inventory_reserved": True
}

# Line 1894-1900: Update database
await db.stock_requests.update_one(
    {"id": request_id},
    {"$set": update_data, "$push": {"workflow_history": workflow_entry}}
)

# Line 1911-1915: Automatically move to manager queue ✅
await db.stock_requests.update_one(
    {"id": request_id},
    {"$set": {"status": InternalOrderStatus.PENDING_MANAGER_APPROVAL}}
)
```

**This automatic transition was already working! The frontend just wasn't calling it.**

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario:

**1. Sales creates request:**
```bash
# Go to Sales Dashboard
# Click "Request Stock" tab
# Select: "Bread Flour, 10 bags, Berhane Branch"

```

**2. Owner approves:**
```bash
# Go to Owner Dashboard
# Click "Approvals" button
# Switch to "Stock Requests (Real Data)" tab  ← NEW!

```

**3. Manager sees request:**
```bash
# Go to Manager Dashboard
# Click "Approvals Queue" tab
# → Should NOW see the request ✅

```

**4. Storekeeper fulfills:**
```bash
# Go to Storekeeper Dashboard

# Pick items and mark delivered
```
