> "This is not a prototype. This is production-ready code with 57% completion. Core operations work today. We add advanced reports and training over the next 4 weeks while you're already using it."

---

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Be Honest)

### Not Yet Implemented:
1. **Charts/Graphs** - Dashboards show numbers, not visualizations (Phase 5)
2. **Advanced Reports** - Excel/PDF export, scheduled reports (Phase 5)
3. **External Integrations** - Bank API, SMS notifications (Future)
4. **Native Mobile App** - Web works on mobile, native app not built

### Be Ready to Say:
> "We're at 57% completion. What you're seeing is the operational core - sales, finance, production, approvals - all working. The remaining 43% is advanced reporting, automated testing, and training materials. We can deploy what you're seeing today and add the rest while you're using it."

## 📞 EMERGENCY BACKUP PLANS

### If Backend Crashes:
- **Plan A:** Restart backend (`python server.py`)
- **Plan B:** Use screenshots + talk through features
- **Plan C:** "Let me show you the demo environment" → `/demo` route

### If Frontend Has Issues:
- **Plan A:** Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
- **Plan B:** Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- **Plan C:** Open in different browser

### If Demo Data Missing:
- **Plan A:** Re-run `python seed_demo_data.py`
- **Plan B:** Navigate to `/demo` routes (simplified demo)
- **Plan C:** Use mockData.js (static demo data)

### If You Forget Something:
- ✅ **It's OK!** Clients expect notes/scripts
- ✅ Quick glance at script is professional
- ✅ Say: "Let me make sure I cover everything important..."
