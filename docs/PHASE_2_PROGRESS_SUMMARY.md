# Phase 2 Implementation Progress - Stock Request Workflow

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Phase:** 2 - Stock Request Workflow (Multi-Level Approval)  
**Status:** üöß **60% Complete** (Backend done, Frontend in progress)

---

## üéØ Phase 2 Goals

Implement complete 6-stage approval workflow for stock requests:
1. **Sales** creates request
2. **Admin/Owner** approves ‚Üí reserves inventory
3. **Manager** approves ‚Üí authorizes fulfillment
4. **Storekeeper** fulfills ‚Üí deducts inventory
5. **Guard** verifies at gate ‚Üí issues gate pass
6. **Sales** confirms delivery ‚Üí inventory transferred

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 2.1 Workflow Models & Database Schema ‚úì
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `InternalOrderStatus` enum with 11 new statuses
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `InternalOrderRequisition` model with workflow tracking
- ‚úÖ Created `WorkflowStage` model for tracking each stage
- ‚úÖ Added inventory reservation fields
- ‚úÖ Added workflow history tracking
- ‚úÖ Created action models for each stage:
  - `AdminApprovalAction`
  - `ManagerApprovalAction`
  - `FulfillmentAction`
  - `GateVerificationAction`
  - `DeliveryConfirmationAction`
  - `InternalOrderRejection`

**New Statuses:**
```python
PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL     # Stage 1: Waiting for admin
ADMIN_APPROVED              # Admin approved
PENDING_MANAGER_APPROVAL    # Stage 2: Waiting for manager
MANAGER_APPROVED            # Manager approved
PENDING_FULFILLMENT         # Stage 3: Waiting for storekeeper
READY_FOR_PICKUP            # Packaged and ready
AT_GATE                     # Stage 4: At gate checkpoint
IN_TRANSIT                  # Stage 5: Out for delivery
DELIVERED                   # Arrived at destination
CONFIRMED                   # Stage 6: Sales confirmed receipt
REJECTED                    # Rejected at any stage
```

---

### 2.7 Branch-Specific Routing ‚úì
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- ‚úÖ Created `determine_source_branch()` helper function
- ‚úÖ Automatic product-to-warehouse mapping
- ‚úÖ Validates product availability before request creation

**Product Routing:**
```javascript
Product Mapping:
- 1st Quality products ‚Üí main_warehouse
- Bread Flour products ‚Üí girmay_warehouse
- White Fruskela ‚Üí main_warehouse
- Red Fruskela ‚Üí girmay_warehouse
- Furska ‚Üí main_warehouse
```

**How it Works:**
```python
# Auto-detects source branch when request is created
source_branch = await determine_source_branch(product_name)

# Example:
"1st Quality 50kg" ‚Üí main_warehouse
"Bread Flour 25kg" ‚Üí girmay_warehouse
```

---

### 2.8 Inventory Reservation System ‚úì
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- ‚úÖ Created `reserve_inventory()` function
- ‚úÖ Created `deduct_inventory_for_fulfillment()` function
- ‚úÖ Created `add_inventory_for_delivery()` function
- ‚úÖ Inventory state tracking (available ‚Üí reserved ‚Üí deducted ‚Üí transferred)

**Inventory Flow:**
```
1. Request Created
   ‚Üí Check availability
   ‚Üí Validate stock exists
   
2. Admin Approves
   ‚Üí inventory_reserved = true
   ‚Üí Stock marked as "reserved" (not yet deducted)
   
3. Storekeeper Fulfills
   ‚Üí inventory_deducted = true
   ‚Üí Stock physically removed from warehouse
   ‚Üí Inventory quantity decremented
   
4. Sales Confirms
   ‚Üí delivery_confirmed = true
   ‚Üí Stock added to destination branch
   ‚Üí Complete transfer
```

**Functions:**
- `reserve_inventory()` - Validates availability
- `deduct_inventory_for_fulfillment()` - Removes from source
- `add_inventory_for_delivery()` - Adds to destination
