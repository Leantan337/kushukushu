## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Verify Current State
```bash
cd backend
python fix_branch_products.py
```

This will:
- Check for incorrectly assigned products
- Remove products that shouldn't exist at a branch
- Report any missing products
- Display verification summary

### 2. Update Products (if needed)
```bash
cd backend
python update_branch_products.py
```

This will:
- Add missing branch-specific products
- Skip products that already exist
- Display product summary for each branch

### 3. Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
python server.py
```

---

## üìä Product Routing Logic

The system uses `determine_source_branch()` to route stock requests:

```python
EXCLUSIVE TO GIRMAY:
  "1st Quality" ‚Üí "girmay"
  "Fruskelo White" ‚Üí "girmay"

EXCLUSIVE TO BERHANE:
  "TDF" ‚Üí "berhane"
  "Fruskelo Red" ‚Üí "berhane"

AVAILABLE AT BOTH:
  "Bread" ‚Üí "both" (routes to branch with higher stock)
  "Fruska" ‚Üí "both" (routes to branch with higher stock)
```
