# Sales Role Improvement - Phased Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation plan for improving and enhancing the Sales Role functionality in the Flour Factory ERP system. The improvements focus on better inventory integration, enhanced POS capabilities, multi-level approval workflows, and new loan management features.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components
1. **SalesDashboard.jsx** - Main dashboard with tabs for different functions
2. **POSTransaction.jsx** - Point of Sale for selling products
3. **InventoryRequestForm.jsx** - Request flour stock from warehouse
4. **PurchaseRequestForm.jsx** - Request purchase approval
5. **SalesReports.jsx** - View sales performance

### Current Issues Identified
- Mock recent activity data (static, not dynamic)
- Limited product catalog (only pulls from backend)
- Payment methods exist but not fully integrated with finance
- Stock requests lack multi-level approval workflow
- No proper inventory routing by branch
- No loan/credit tracking system
- No order management feature
- Reports need refinement

---
