## Next Steps

### 1. Test Admin Approval
```bash
# View admin queue
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requisitions?status=pending_admin_approval"

# Approve one (replace {id} with actual ID)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requisitions/{id}/approve-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"approved_by": "Admin Name", "notes": "Approved"}'
```

### 2. Check Finance Queue
```bash
# After admin approves, check finance queue
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requisitions?status=admin_approved"
```

### 3. Test High-Value Request
```bash
# Create request over Br 50,000 (should go to Owner)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "New Equipment",
    "estimated_cost": 75000,
    "requested_by": "Sales Person"
  }'

# Check owner queue
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-requisitions?status=pending_owner_approval"

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Database Name:** The actual data is in `test_database`, not `kushukushu_erp`!

I've created `backend/.env` to configure this. Make sure:
1. The backend is restarted to pick up the new .env file
2. Or set the environment variable: `DB_NAME=test_database`

## Organizational Structure (Confirmed)

```
1. OWNER (Top Authority)
   - Final approvals for high-value purchases (> Br 50,000)

2. ADMIN (Next to Owner)
   - Approves routine purchases (≤ Br 50,000)

3. FINANCE
   - Tracks all transactions
   - Processes payments after approval

4. SALES
   - Creates purchase requests
   - Can pay from daily revenue

5. MANAGER
   - **Factory operations ONLY**
   - **NOT in purchase approval chain!**
```
