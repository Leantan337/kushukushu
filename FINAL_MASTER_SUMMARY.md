---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed (7 Total)

### 1. Sales Dashboard Overview Not Working ✅
**Problem:** Stats showing 0, activity feed empty, no loading states

**Solution:**
- Fixed activity data transformation (timestamp → time)
- Added loading spinners
- Enhanced error handling
- Added refresh button

**Files:** `SalesDashboard.jsx`

---

### 2. Owner Approvals Screen 404 Error ✅
**Problem:** `GET /api/purchase-requisitions?status=admin_approved 404 (Not Found)`

**Solution:**
- Added GET `/api/purchase-requisitions` endpoint
- Added GET `/api/purchase-requisitions/{id}` endpoint
- Fixed HTTP methods (POST → PUT)

**Files:** `backend/server.py`, `ApprovalsScreen.jsx`

---

### 3. Incorrect Purchase Request Flow ✅
**Problem:** Manager was in approval chain (should only handle factory operations)

**Solution:**
- Removed manager approval entirely
- Added automatic routing based on amount
- Admin approves ≤ Br 50,000
- Owner approves > Br 50,000

**Files:** `backend/server.py`

---

### 4. Purchase Requests Stuck in Old Status ✅
**Problem:** 7 requests with status "pending" (old workflow)

**Solution:**
- Found correct database: `test_database`
- Updated all 7 requests to "pending_admin_approval"
- Removed manager approval fields

**Scripts:** `fix_test_database.py`

---

### 5. Admin Can't See Purchase Requests ✅
**Problem:** Admin had no screen to view/approve purchase requests

**Solution:**
- Created `AdminPurchaseApprovals.jsx` component
- Added route `/admin/purchase-approvals`
- Added navigation button in Admin Dashboard

**Files:** `AdminPurchaseApprovals.jsx`, `AdminDashboard.jsx`, `App.js`

---

### 6. Finance Not Showing Admin-Approved Requests ✅
**Problem:** Finance only fetched "owner_approved", missed "admin_approved"

**Solution:**
- Backend now returns both statuses in `/api/finance/pending-authorizations`
- Finance Dashboard shows correct status badges
- Updated description text
- Process Payment button visible for both types

**Files:** `backend/server.py`, `FinanceDashboard.jsx`

---

### 7. Payment Processing 400 Error ✅ (Final Fix!)
**Problem:** `POST /api/finance/process-payment/{id} 400 (Bad Request)` - Only accepted owner_approved

**Solution:**
- Payment endpoint now accepts BOTH admin_approved and owner_approved
- Enhanced error messages
- Better activity logging
- Added completion timestamp

**Files:** `backend/server.py` (Line 535)

---

## 🎯 The Correct Workflow (Fully Implemented)

### Organizational Structure:
```
👑 OWNER (Top) - Approves > Br 50,000
    ↓
👤 ADMIN (Can approve ≤ Br 50,000)
    ↓
💰 FINANCE (Tracks & pays everything)
    ↓
📊 SALES (Creates requests)

🏭 MANAGER - Factory only, NOT in purchase chain!
```

### Purchase Request Flow:
```
SALES creates request
    ↓
IF Amount ≤ Br 50,000        IF Amount > Br 50,000
    ↓                             ↓
ADMIN approves               OWNER approves
    ↓                             ↓
Status: admin_approved       Status: owner_approved
    └─────────┬─────────┘
              ↓
    FINANCE processes payment
              ↓
        Status: completed
```
