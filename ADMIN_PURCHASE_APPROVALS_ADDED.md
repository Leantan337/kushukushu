# ‚úÖ Admin Purchase Approvals Screen Added!

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** You created a purchase request (PR-20251012162505-c06a for Br 2,500), and it showed in Owner's activity feed as "Routed to ADMIN", but Admin couldn't see it because **there was no Admin screen for purchase approvals!**

**Solution:** Created a dedicated Admin Purchase Approvals screen.
